# Lesson 1: Linux Terminal Navigation

**Date:** April 13, 2025  
**Goal:** Learn basic terminal navigation commands in Linux.

## 🧠 Commands Learned

- `pwd` — Print working directory
- `ls` — List directory contents
- `cd` — Change directory
- `mkdir` — Make directory
- `touch` — Create a new empty file
- `rm` — Remove a file
- `rmdir` — Remove a directory

## 📝 Notes

- Linux is case-sensitive. `Documents` and `documents` are two different folders.
- Use `cd ..` to go up one level in the file system.
- You can combine commands like `mkdir test && cd test`.

## 💡 Reflection

Practiced moving around the file system, creating and deleting files and folders. I’m getting more comfortable with the command line interface.
